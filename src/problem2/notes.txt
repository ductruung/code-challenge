Right now, I need to understand the problem:
- The user "swap assets from one currency to another." => It means that we first pick the
currencies to swap. We then input the amount to send/receive. We then hit swap.

Assumption:
- We have unlimited amount in our balance.

UI:
- Something modern like OKX.
